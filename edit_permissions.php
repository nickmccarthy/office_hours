// TODO:

// query users join teaches join class with uid to get permission level

// query class join permissions and for each permission available to that level,
// print the name of that permission and a pair of checkboxes. Also look up the current
// permission settings for that class and use to set default values for the checkboxes.

// on form submission, set the value of the permissions in the DB with those
// values from the checkboxes. May be the same as before but doesn't matter.
